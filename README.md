BG's dotemacs redux
===================

A completely new approach based on `Cask` and `use-package`.

To install `Cask` on OS X run the following command `brew install cask`

To start dotemacs setup on OS X run the following command `EMACS="/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs" cask install`

Still a work in progress...
